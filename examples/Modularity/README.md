# BLambda Modularity

BLambda Shell with few basic modules.

Do you know about Microfrontend?

>Microfrontends is a front-end web development pattern in which a single application may be built from disparate builds. It is analogous to a microservices approach but for client-side single-page applications written in JavaScript. It is a solution to de-composition and routing for multiple front-end applications.

Thus, the idea remains the same. You can consider Module == Microservices and Shell == Orchestrator, if you prefer, for our BLambda Shell UI app. In fact, the Shell is currently serving as a shared component for modules, but it's still a work in progress..
